# random-password

This program takes values that are set and makes a random password with as many characters that you would like. You can change the values
you want in your password by changing it in the boxes that are provided. you can also just uncheck the checkmark on the left and it wont 
use any of the values that are in that box. if you messed it up you can just reset to what it was in the beginning. on the bottom of the 
page you also have a botton that will copy the password that the browser creaated for you. I didnt put a cap on how many characters you 
can use so have fun with that!

this assignment was actually quite fun and I really enjoyed making this program and adding stuff overtime. I started by just prompting 
the user with questions and I didnt like that so I changed that so that you can change what things you want in it and how many characters
on the actual page itself. 

I would love feedback on things that you would change and things to make the code look nicer. I know that this is a work in progress so 
it wont look super professional right now but that will come with time. feel free to email me whenever, I try to look at it everyday so 
dont be afraid when I dont respond right away.
