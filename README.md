## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for 
development and testing purposes. They will also give an overview of some of the app's functionality. 

### Installing

Git clone the repository to your local machine:

HTTPS:
````
$ git clone https://github.com/dawson-hamilton/random-password.git

You will then open the code by running this in the command line:

Once the code is open all you have to do is right click on the index.HTML file and and click "Open in default browser" or use the keyboard shortcut.
