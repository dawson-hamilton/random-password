        <p style="text-align: center;">
            Below you see a list of boxes that have different characters in them. You have a box for the upper case
            letter, you have a box for all the lowercase letters, you have a box fro all the numbers and you also have a
            box for all the special characters. You can see that these are input boxes because you can go in and delete
            whatever character from those boxes that you dont what in your password. You will also see a reset button
            next to the boxes that if you deleted a bunch of things on accident then it will reset it to what it was
            before you deleted any of the characters. To the left of the input boxes you will se a little checkbox that
            you can hit that will just not put any of the chacters in the password if the check mark isnt there. If
            you want to put all those characters in the possibility of characters again then just make sure that the
            check mark is on the little box. At the bottom you can see that you can chose how many characters you want
            the password to be (password has to be 8-128 characcters long). when you are done you can click the copy
            to clipboard button and you can just go and paste it into wherever you tell it to.
